Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
Drink and the devil had done for the rest—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
The mate was fixed by the bos'n's pike.
The bos'n brained with a marlinspike
And Cookey's throat was marked belike
﻿﻿It had been gripped
﻿﻿﻿By fingers ten;
﻿﻿And there they lay,
﻿﻿﻿All good dead men,
Like break-o'-day in a boozing-ken—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
Fifteen men of a whole ship's list—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
Dead and bedamned, and the rest gone whist!—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
The skipper lay with his nob in gore
Where the scullion's axe his cheek had shore
And the scullion he was stabbed times four.
﻿﻿And there they lay,
﻿﻿﻿And the soggy skies
﻿﻿Dripped all day long
﻿﻿﻿In up-staring eyes—
At murk sunset and at foul sunrise—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!

Fifteen men of 'em stiff and stark—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
Ten of the crew had the Murder mark—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
'Twas a cutlass swipe, or an ounce of lead,
Or a yawing hole in a battered head—
And the scuppers glut with a rotting red.
﻿﻿And there they lay—
﻿﻿﻿Aye, damn my eyes!—
﻿﻿All lookouts clapped
﻿﻿﻿On paradise—
All souls bound just contrariwise—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!

Fifteen men of 'era good and true—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
Every man jack could ha' sailed with Old Pew—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
There was chest on chest full of Spanish gold,
With a ton of plate in the middle hold,
And the cabins riot of stuff untold.
﻿﻿And they lay there
﻿﻿﻿That had took the plum,
﻿﻿With sightless glare
﻿﻿﻿And their lips struck dumb,
While we shared all by the rule of thumb—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!

More was seen through the sternlight screen—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
Chartings ondoubt where a woman had been—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
A flimsy shift on a bunker cot,
With a thin dirk slot through the bosom spot
And the lace stiff-dry in a purplish blot.
﻿﻿Or was she wench . . .
﻿﻿﻿Or some shuddering maid
﻿﻿That dared the knife
﻿﻿﻿And that took the blade?
By God! she was stuff for a plucky jade!—
﻿﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!

Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
We wrapped 'em all in a mains'l tight,
With twice ten turns of a hawser's bight,
And we heaved 'era over and out of sight—
﻿﻿With a yo—heave—ho!
﻿﻿﻿And a fare—you—well!
﻿﻿And a sullen plunge
﻿﻿﻿In the sullen swell,
Ten fathoms deep on the road to hell—
﻿Yo—ho—ho and a bottle of rum!
